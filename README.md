# Pioneer-3dx Simulator

Pioneer-3dx robot has been [discontinued](https://www.generationrobots.com/en/402395-robot-mobile-pioneer-3-dx.html), however, many universities and institute are still using them for experiment. To facilitate the simulation for pioneer-3dx, I have done some changes on [sidneyrdc](https://github.com/sidneyrdc/p3dx_gazebo) to make it better and easier for other users to utilize. I am aware that there are already many pioneer-3dx gazebo models out there, however, they are not well structured. Therefore, I am trying to follow the [husky](https://github.com/husky) simulation structure to rearragement the simulator as I believe they have setup a very good simulation. Feel free to contact me if you would like to contribute.
